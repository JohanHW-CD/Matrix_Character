# Matrix characteristics

### Python nestles lists returning its properties interpreted as a matrix

A mathematical matrix within a real vector space can be of many different types, stochastic,
unitary, normal and so forth. This module tests a given matrix represented as a nestled list, allows for basic
matrix operations that would change its type, and then allows for tests of its type.

### Installation
